## Lab 2

**Introduction:
Today we will introduce the JavaScript programming language, along with clarifying its relationship with HTML in how it adds functionality to it.**

Office hours for 7/18:
9:35p-10:35a, Room 328

JavaScript is a primarily front-end programming language that shares similarities with other high level languages. This is a great language to learn because it shares concepts such as if-else conditionals and for loops, but can be practiced at a lower level.

Much of the things you learn can be immediately practiced for understanding, and we will get into how to do so.

Building upon things from the last lab, we will learn how to manipulate and target the HTML elements on the page we previously created and identified with the 'id' property.

First, we will discuss variables in JavaScript. Variables are simply entities used to store values. In math, you are usually trying to solve for a variable's value. In programming, we already know what the values are because we are defining them. We define vaiables using the `var` keyword:
```
var me = "Mikos";
```

In that example, we created a variable called "me", with a value of "Mikos".


Voila! You have a basic skeleton of an HTML page with a heading, div sections, a form, and a button. This is all you need to house the quizzer on the HTML side. We will learn more about adding functionality to the button and introducing another language, JavaScript, to you in the next lab.

Feel free to Google concepts that you either you are having trouble with, or desire to learn more information about. A great website to use to learn more about the topics discussed in class:<br>

Simply go here, search a specific topic, and you'll find detailed exmplanations and examples of all the topics that were discussed today.
