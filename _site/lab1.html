Lab 1

Introduction:
Today we will be reviewing basic concepts in HTML. We will dissect the components of an HTML page, discussing different elements & tags.

HTML pages are complete objects comprised of components called "elements". Every HTML page has elements. Think of it this way: in chemistry, matter is composed of core elements. Every piece of matter contain elements from the same base elements found in the periodic table. You can view web page elements as exhibiting the same functionality.

Just as every element on the periodic table has properties that make them unique, the same can be said about HTML elements. 

Every HTML page has encapsulating tags; meaning that the tag begins, content is added within the tag, and the tag is closed off with a matching tag. For example, every HTML page has "master" HTML tags, with an opening <html> tag, and ending with a <pre></html></pre> tag.
<pre>
<html>
{page content}
</html>
</pre>
