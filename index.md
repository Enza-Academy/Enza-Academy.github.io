We would like to welcome you to STEM with Enza Academy!

Over the course of the next few days we will be teaching you software programming. We aim to simplify learning how to write computer programs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During this process, we will introduce and review topics such as elements, CSS classes, variables, and functions.

What you will be doing:
You will be creating a simple quizzer tool with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the quizzer tool, you will be able to create questions with answers, and inform the test-taker of their results. This is not a simple feat, nor is it too difficult. We will incrementally build this quizzer tool day-by-day. By the end of the program, you should be able to not only understand the code behind it, but be able to customize it to how you see fit. We also think this could come in handy during study time! ;)

How the class will run:
We will attempt to replicate the software programming environment as much as possible, meaning our sessions will be run as "Labs". This is the same format in which you would encounter in a college computer programming course. Each day will represent a lab, and you will have a set of learning objectives each session. We will go over the lab materials in class, and you will be given a printout of the lab for a reference. You will also be given a link to a virtual version of the lab page.

Expectations:
Since we will be doing the lab exercises in class, you should be able to complete the lab exercises by the end of the class. If not, that's no big deal either! You can simply review your copies of the lab session for the current day, and complete it before the next lab session. However, we expect the previous lab to be completed before the start of the next lab, because we will be building cumulatively.
